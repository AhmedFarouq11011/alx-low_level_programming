#Function and Nested loops README notes
1-alphabet.c we print the alphabet using for loop to iterate over the string of the alphabet 
 <br/>
2-print_alphabet_x10.c we do the same except this time we use another for loop to do it 10 times
3-islower.c simple and obviouse use islower()from the library ctype.h just #include <ctype.h>
<br/>
4-isalpha same as before except using isalpha()instead

1-pos_or_neg //simple if else if else statement
1-last_digit trick here is adding 2 place holders and then arrange the varibale after the quotes accordingy yes and %10 will give the last digit of any number thats 2 digits or more
2-print_alphabet //the trick is to use the ascii code of a and then increase it by 1 in the while loop and break out if when you reach the ascii code of z 
3-print_alphabet //same as the one before except adding another while loop for the upper case
4-print_alphabet // trick is add if else inside the while loop so you wont print e or q checkin their ascii value and continue after incrementing
5-print_numbers basic print statemnt
6-print_numberz //same concept putchar(asciivalue)
7-print_tebahpla // reversing the normal alphabet by going from ascii z to ascii a while loop and decrmenting
8-print_base16.c //same concept as before with two while loops one for 0-9 and one for a-f
9-print_comb.c // trick is covering the corner case which is the last number you can achieve that by having an if statement check if its the last number or not and act accordingly
101-print_comb4.c // trick is triple nested loop with the out loop iterate from 7 2nd loop 8 and last loop 9
102-print_combo5.c// ok this one's trick the no repeating part you can make sure you wont repeat your self by making sure you only print when the 2nd two numbers are bigger than the first ones  by basically using the first two loop and create a 2 digit number from them and do the same with the 2nd two digits from the nested loops inside you turn them into two digits by simply multiplying 1 by 10 and adding it to the other you multiply the outer loop and add the inner loop to it example loop i loop j i = 9 j = 6 to get the two digit number u do this i*10+j = 9*10+9 = 96 thats it
